summary: "Understanding the key differences between JSON and JSONB data types in PostgreSQL and when to use which."
---

PostgreSQL offers two types for storing JSON data: `json` and `jsonb`. While they both accept valid JSON input, they differ significantly in how they store and process that data.

## The JSON Data Type

The `json` data type stores an exact copy of the input text. This means:
- It preserves whitespace
- It preserves the order of keys
- It preserves duplicate keys

It is essentially a text field with JSON validation.

## The JSONB Data Type

The `jsonb` (JSON Binary) data type stores data in a decomposed binary format. This means:
- It does not preserve whitespace
- It does not preserve the order of keys
- It does not preserve duplicate keys (last value wins)

## Performance

`jsonb` is generally preferred because it supports indexing and is faster to process. However, `json` is slightly faster to ingest since it doesn't require parsing overhead.

## Conclusion

For most use cases, especially where you need to query the JSON data, **use `jsonb`**. Use `json` only if you need to preserve the exact input format (like for legacy systems).
